# 🔍 Console Debug Analysis Session

## Target Issues to Debug:
1. **UNK vs UNK** - Team names showing as "UNK vs UNK" instead of real team names
2. **Identical Odds** - Over/under odds showing as +100/+100 instead of realistic spreads
3. **Prop Name Formatting** - Already fixed but verify it's working
4. **Data Flow** - Ensure API → Backend → Frontend data flow is correct

## Debugging System Deployed:
✅ **Backend Edge Function**: Comprehensive logging of API responses and data processing
✅ **Frontend Analysis**: Detailed prop object analysis and issue detection
✅ **Team Normalization**: Utility to handle team name variations
✅ **Force Refresh**: Bypassing cache to get fresh data

## Expected Console Output:

### Backend (Edge Function Logs):
```
🎯 EVENT 12345 FULL ANALYSIS:
📊 Raw Event Structure: { full JSON from SportGameOdds API }
🏠 Home Team Analysis: { team extraction details }
🚗 Away Team Analysis: { team extraction details }
🎲 CREATING PROP: Josh Allen - Passing Yards
📊 Full Prop Object: { complete prop details }
⚠️ UNK Check: { UNK detection results }
```

### Frontend (Browser Console):
```
🎯 FRONTEND PLAYER PROPS ANALYSIS:
📊 Total Props Received: X
🔍 DETAILED FIRST PROP ANALYSIS:
🏠 Team Data: { team, opponent, teamAbbr, opponentAbbr }
💰 Odds Data: { overOdds, underOdds, line, sportsbooks }
⚠️ UNK Issues Found: X props have UNK values
⚠️ Identical Odds Issues: X props have identical odds
```

## Analysis Steps:
1. Access http://localhost:8087/
2. Navigate to Player Props tab
3. Open browser dev console (F12)
4. Look for our debugging output
5. Identify specific issues in the data flow
6. Use ChatGPT for additional analysis and solutions

## Key Things to Look For:
- Raw API response structure from SportGameOdds
- Which team fields contain actual data vs empty
- How odds are formatted in the API response
- Whether our parsing logic is working correctly
- Any errors in the data transformation process
