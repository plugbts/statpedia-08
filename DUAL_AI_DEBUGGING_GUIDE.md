## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Debugging UNK vs UNK Issue

**Debug Input:**
```
Issue: Player props showing "UNK vs UNK" instead of real team names
Expected: "Buffalo Bills vs Miami Dolphins"
Actual: "UNK vs UNK"
Error: No specific error, just wrong data display

Code:
const homeTeam = event.homeTeam?.name || 'UNK';
const awayTeam = event.awayTeam?.name || 'UNK';
```

**Expected Output:**
- **ChatGPT**: Suggests multiple API field fallbacks, data structure analysis
- **Claude**: Provides specific code fixes, enhanced error handling

### Example 2: Code Review for Odds Parsing

**Review Input:**
```
Purpose: Parse American odds from various API formats
Code:
function parseOdds(odds) {
  return parseInt(odds) || 100;
}
```

**Expected Output:**
- **ChatGPT**: Suggests robust type checking, multiple format support
- **Claude**: Provides TypeScript implementation, error handling improvements

### Example 3: Brainstorming API Rate Limiting

**Brainstorm Input:**
```
Problem: SportGameOdds API has rate limits, need to optimize usage
Constraints: Real-time data requirements, multiple users, cost efficiency
```

**Expected Output:**
- **ChatGPT**: Suggests caching strategies, background polling, user queuing
- **Claude**: Provides implementation details, database design, monitoring

## Best Practices

### üéØ **When to Use Each Mode**

**Use Debug Mode When:**
- You have a specific error or unexpected behavior
- You need step-by-step troubleshooting guidance
- You want multiple debugging approaches

**Use Code Review When:**
- You want to improve existing code quality
- You're unsure about best practices
- You need architecture feedback

**Use Brainstorm Mode When:**
- You're planning new features
- You need creative solutions to complex problems
- You want to explore different implementation approaches

### üìã **Writing Effective Prompts**

**For Debugging:**
- Be specific about the expected vs actual behavior
- Include relevant error messages
- Provide minimal reproducible code snippets
- Mention your environment and constraints

**For Code Review:**
- Explain the purpose and context of the code
- Include the full function or component
- Mention any specific concerns or requirements
- Ask about performance, security, or maintainability

**For Brainstorming:**
- Clearly define the problem you're trying to solve
- List any technical constraints or requirements
- Mention your preferred technologies or approaches
- Ask for multiple solution options with pros/cons

### üîí **Security Considerations**

- **API Key Security**: Your OpenAI API key is stored locally in your browser
- **Code Privacy**: Code snippets are sent to OpenAI's API for analysis
- **Data Handling**: Don't include sensitive data (passwords, API keys, personal info)
- **Cost Management**: Monitor your OpenAI API usage to control costs

## Integration with Current Debugging

### üîÑ **Workflow Integration**

1. **Start with Current Tools**: Use browser dev tools, console logs, etc.
2. **Identify the Issue**: Gather error messages, unexpected behavior details
3. **Use Dual AI**: Get multiple perspectives on the problem
4. **Implement Solutions**: Apply the best combination of suggestions
5. **Iterate**: Use code review mode to validate your fixes

### üé≠ **AI Personality Differences**

**Claude (Me):**
- Systematic and methodical approach
- Focus on immediate fixes and error handling
- Strong in TypeScript/React specifics
- Emphasis on debugging steps and logging

**ChatGPT:**
- Creative and alternative thinking
- Focus on architectural patterns and best practices
- Strong in general software engineering principles
- Emphasis on multiple solution approaches

### üìä **Tracking and Learning**

- **Session History**: All debug sessions are saved for reference
- **Pattern Recognition**: Notice common issues and solutions
- **Skill Development**: Learn from both AI perspectives
- **Documentation**: Use insights to improve your debugging skills

## Current Issues to Test With

### üéØ **Immediate Testing Opportunities**

1. **Team Name Extraction**: UNK vs UNK issue
2. **Odds Parsing**: +100/+100 identical odds problem
3. **API Rate Limiting**: Optimize SportGameOdds usage
4. **Data Caching**: Improve performance and reduce API calls
5. **Error Handling**: Better user experience for API failures

### üöÄ **Advanced Use Cases**
