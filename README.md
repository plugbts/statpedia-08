git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

## ðŸ”’ Data Quality & UNK Prevention System

This project includes a comprehensive system to prevent `UNK` and `-` values from entering the database. The system provides multi-layered protection:

### Quick Start

```bash
# Validate data before ingestion
npm run validate:ingestion

# Check for UNK values in database
npm run monitor:unk

# Clean existing UNK values
npm run backfill:clean-unk:dry-run  # Preview changes
npm run backfill:clean-unk:delete   # Execute cleanup

# Run integration tests
npm run test:unk-prevention
```

### Features

- âœ… **Database Constraints** - CHECK constraints prevent UNK/dash values at insertion
- âœ… **Pre-Ingestion Validation** - Validate data before it reaches the database
- âœ… **Automated Cleanup** - Scripts to find and remove existing bad data
- âœ… **Continuous Monitoring** - Automatic checks in CI/CD pipeline
- âœ… **Comprehensive Testing** - Integration tests verify system works correctly

### Documentation

- [`UNK_PREVENTION_GUIDE.md`](UNK_PREVENTION_GUIDE.md) - Complete usage guide
- [`IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`](IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md) - Technical implementation details
- [`db/migrations/0005_prevent_unk_values.sql`](db/migrations/0005_prevent_unk_values.sql) - Database constraints

### Architecture

The system implements defense in depth:

1. **Layer 1**: Pre-validation catches bad data before database
2. **Layer 2**: Database constraints enforce data quality
3. **Layer 3**: Continuous monitoring detects any issues
4. **Layer 4**: CI/CD integration blocks bad deployments

See the documentation for complete details on implementation and usage.
