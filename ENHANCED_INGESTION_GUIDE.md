# üîß Enhanced Prop Ingestion System - Fixing Missing Props, Injury Filtering, and Prop Names

## üéØ **Problems Fixed**

### ‚ùå **Before (Issues)**
- **Only two props** showing (Lamar's props only)
- **Injured players** still appearing (e.g., Lamar showing when injured)
- **Prop types flattened** to "Yards" instead of specific names
- **Incomplete slate** processing

### ‚úÖ **After (Fixed)**
- **Full slate processing** - all players and props from API
- **Proper injury filtering** - excludes Out/Inactive/Doubtful players
- **Specific prop names** - "Passing Yards", "Rushing Yards", "Receiving Yards"
- **Complete data pipeline** with validation

## üèóÔ∏è **Enhanced Architecture**

### **Schema Adjustments (League-aware)**
```sql
-- Enhanced props table with conflict resolution
CREATE TABLE props (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  player_id UUID REFERENCES players(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  team_id UUID REFERENCES teams(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  game_id TEXT,
  prop_type TEXT NOT NULL,        -- Specific names: "Passing Yards", "Rushing Yards"
  line NUMERIC,                   -- Betting line
  odds TEXT,                      -- Odds string
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'Active',   -- Player status
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now()
);
```

### **Enhanced Prop Type Normalization**
```typescript
// NFL specific mappings (no more generic "Yards")
function normalizePropType(market: string, sport: string): string {
  switch (market.toLowerCase()) {
    case "passing_yards": return "Passing Yards";
    case "rushing_yards": return "Rushing Yards";
    case "receiving_yards": return "Receiving Yards";
    case "receptions": return "Receptions";
    case "passing_tds": return "Passing Touchdowns";
    case "rushing_tds": return "Rushing Touchdowns";
    // ... more specific mappings
  }
}
```

### **Enhanced Injury Filtering**
```typescript
function isPlayerActive(player: any): boolean {
  const rawStatus = (player.status ?? player.injury_status ?? "Active").toLowerCase();
  
  // Inactive statuses (exclude these)
  const inactiveStatuses = ["out", "injured", "suspended", "doubtful", "ir", "pup", "nfir"];
  
  // Check for inactive keywords
  for (const inactive of inactiveStatuses) {
    if (rawStatus.includes(inactive)) {
      return false; // Skip this player
    }
  }
  
  return true; // Include this player
}
```

## üöÄ **Usage**

### **Enhanced Ingestion Commands**
```bash
# Run enhanced ingestion for specific league
npm run ingest:enhanced nfl

# Run enhanced ingestion for all leagues
npm run ingest:enhanced all

# Run with validation
npm run ingest:enhanced nfl --validate

# Run with clearing old data
npm run ingest:enhanced nfl --clear
```

### **Direct TypeScript Usage**
```typescript
import { ingestPropsEnhanced, validateIngestion } from './src/services/enhanced-prop-ingestion';

// Ingest NFL props with enhanced processing
await ingestPropsEnhanced('nfl');

// Validate the results
await validateIngestion();

// Ingest all leagues
await ingestAllLeaguesEnhanced();
```

## üìä **Validation Queries**

### **1. Check Total Props (Should Show Full Slate)**
```sql
SELECT 
  l.code as league,
  COUNT(p.id) as total_props,
  COUNT(DISTINCT p.player_id) as unique_players
FROM props p
JOIN teams t ON p.team_id = t.id
JOIN leagues l ON t.league_id = l.id
GROUP BY l.code
ORDER BY total_props DESC;
```

### **2. Check Prop Types (Should Show Specific Names)**
```sql
SELECT 
  l.code as league,
  p.prop_type,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM props p
JOIN teams t ON p.team_id = t.id
JOIN leagues l ON t.league_id = l.id
GROUP BY l.code, p.prop_type
ORDER BY l.code, count DESC;
```

### **3. Check Player Status (Should Only Show Active)**
```sql
SELECT 
  l.code as league,
  pl.status,
  COUNT(*) as player_count
FROM players pl
JOIN teams t ON pl.team_id = t.id
JOIN leagues l ON t.league_id = l.id
GROUP BY l.code, pl.status
ORDER BY l.code, pl.status;
```

## üîç **Expected Results**

### **NFL Props (Example)**
```
league | prop_type          | count
-------|--------------------|-------
NFL    | Passing Yards      | 156
NFL    | Rushing Yards      | 89
NFL    | Receiving Yards    | 134
NFL    | Receptions         | 98
NFL    | Passing Touchdowns | 45
NFL    | Rushing Touchdowns | 23
```

### **Player Status (Should Only Show Active)**
```
league | status  | player_count
-------|---------|-------------
NFL    | Active  | 1247
NBA    | Active  | 450
MLB    | Active  | 780
```

### **Total Props Per League (Full Slate)**
```
league | total_props | unique_players
-------|-------------|---------------
NFL    | 2547        | 1247
NBA    | 1890        | 450
MLB    | 2134        | 780
```

## üõ†Ô∏è **Key Improvements**

### **1. Full Slate Processing**
- **Before**: Only processed subset of players/props
- **After**: Processes entire API response, all games, all players, all markets

### **2. Enhanced Injury Filtering**
- **Before**: Basic status check, injured players still showing
- **After**: Comprehensive status filtering with multiple inactive keywords

### **3. Specific Prop Names**
- **Before**: Generic "Yards", "TDs"
- **After**: "Passing Yards", "Rushing Yards", "Receiving Yards", "Passing Touchdowns"

### **4. Better Error Handling**
- **Before**: Failed silently on errors
- **After**: Detailed logging, continues processing, comprehensive error handling

### **5. Validation & Monitoring**
- **Before**: No validation of results
- **After**: Built-in validation queries, monitoring, and reporting

## üéØ **GraphQL Queries (League-aware)**

### **Get All Active Props for NFL**
```graphql
query GetNFLProps {
  props(
    where: {
      status: { _eq: "Active" }
      team: { league: { code: { _eq: "NFL" } } }
    }
  ) {
    prop_type
    line
    odds
    player {
      name
      position
      status
      team {
        abbreviation
        logo_url
        league {
          code
          name
        }
      }
    }
    game_id
  }
}
```

### **Get Props by Specific Type**
```graphql
query GetPassingYardsProps {
  props(
    where: {
      prop_type: { _eq: "Passing Yards" }
      team: { league: { code: { _eq: "NFL" } } }
    }
  ) {
    line
    odds
    player {
      name
      team {
        abbreviation
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## ‚úÖ **Verification Checklist**

After running enhanced ingestion, verify:

- [ ] **Full slate**: More than 2 props per league
- [ ] **No injured players**: Only Active status players in results
- [ ] **Specific prop names**: "Passing Yards" not "Yards"
- [ ] **All teams represented**: Multiple teams per league
- [ ] **Proper relationships**: Players linked to correct teams/leagues
- [ ] **GraphQL working**: Queries return full nested data
- [ ] **Frontend updated**: Player props tab shows complete data

## üö® **Troubleshooting**

### **Still Only 2 Props?**
- Check API response structure
- Verify game.players array has data
- Check player.props array structure

### **Injured Players Still Showing?**
- Verify player.status field names in API
- Check injury_status, injury fields
- Update inactive status keywords

### **Generic Prop Names?**
- Verify market field names in API
- Check market.type, market.name fields
- Update normalization mapping

Your enhanced ingestion system now provides complete, clean, league-aware prop data! üöÄ
