4. **Click "Fork Collection"**

### Step 3: Priority Collections to Fork First

Start with these essential collections for your player props backend:

#### üèà **NFL Collection**
- **Name:** SportsRadar NFL Official API
- **Use Case:** NFL schedules, teams, players, games
- **Priority:** HIGH ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

After forking, set up these environment variables in your Statpedia workspace:

```json
{
  "sportsradar_api_key": "onLEN0JXRxK7h3OmgCSPOnbkgVvodnrIx1lD4M4D",
  "base_url": "https://api.sportradar.com",
  "current_year": "2025",
  "current_season": "REG",
  "current_date": "2025-01-05"
}
```

### Step 5: Test Forked Collections

After forking each collection:

1. **Open the forked collection** in your workspace
2. **Select your environment** (Statpedia Development)
3. **Test a few key endpoints** to ensure they work
4. **Document which endpoints are working** vs. which need different permissions

## üîß Automation Script

Here's a checklist to systematically fork all collections:

## üìä Expected Results

### ‚úÖ Working Collections (Should work with your API key):
- NFL Official API (schedules, teams, hierarchy)
- NBA Official API (schedules, teams, hierarchy)
- MLB Official API (schedules, teams, hierarchy)
- NHL Official API (schedules, teams, hierarchy)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Collections Requiring Different Permissions:

### üîß Collections for Development:

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Fork with Watching:** Always check "Watch original collection" to get updates
2. **Organize by Sport:** Create folders in your workspace to organize by sport
3. **Test Before Using:** Always test endpoints in Postman before using in code
4. **Document Working Endpoints:** Keep track of which endpoints work with your API key
5. **Set Up Monitors:** Use Postman monitors to track API health
6. **Share with Team:** Export collections for team collaboration

## üéØ Next Steps After Forking

1. **Test all forked collections** with your API key
2. **Document working vs. non-working endpoints**
3. **Update your backend code** to use verified working endpoints
4. **Set up automated testing** with Postman collection runner
5. **Monitor API health** with Postman monitors
6. **Integrate with your player props system**

## üö® Important Notes

- **API Key:** Use your existing SportsRadar API key: `onLEN0JXRxK7h3OmgCSPOnbkgVvodnrIx1lD4M4D`
- **Rate Limits:** Be aware of API rate limits and usage quotas
- **Permissions:** Some endpoints may require different API permissions
- **Updates:** Forked collections will receive updates from the original
- **Testing:** Always test in Postman before implementing in production code

This systematic approach will give you access to all SportsRadar APIs in your workspace for comprehensive testing and development! üöÄ
